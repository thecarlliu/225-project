2. Follow the instructions on the npmjs website (https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
3. Through npm, install yarn (download yarn installer by following the link on https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn)
4. Clone the repository

6. Switch into the client folder (in command line/terminal, run cd ./client) and run yarn install again
7. Run yarn start
